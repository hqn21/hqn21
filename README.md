Senior undergraduate in Computer Science at National Chung Hsing University, passionate about building software that makes a real difference in people's lives. With solid experience across full-stack web development, iOS, and C/C++, from side projects to real-world applications, I enjoy turning ideas into products that work. Currently conducting NLP research on LLM-based multi-agent systems, and eager to keep pushing the boundaries of what LLM Agents can do.
